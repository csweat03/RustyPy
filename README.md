# RustyPy

This is a beta project, that was designed to automate the ticket creation process of the Lumen Technologies proprietary system know as 'OpsConsole'.

As this system is proprietary, the information I can release is limited, but below, you can find a general summary of the application.

This application will open in a command prompt window, you will have an oppourtunity to drop any email inside the /input folder.
Then the application will use a variety of NML processes and validations to pull rich data from the email.
The application will then request you bring up the application 'OpsConsole'
The application will then request mouse and keyboard control and begin to quickly and accurately file this information in a manner unmatched of a trained specialist.
